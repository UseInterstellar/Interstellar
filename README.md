3. For Bun: Run either `config=true bun start` or `$env:config=true; bun start` if you prefer Bun.
4. For NPM: Run either `config=true npm start` or `$env:config=true; npm start` if you prefer NPM.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UseInterstellar/Interstellar
cd Interstellar
```

#### What happened to Replit Deployment?

As of January 1st, 2024, Replit is [no longer free](https://blog.replit.com/hosting-changes). Try GitHub Codespaces instead.

### GitHub Codespaces

> [!NOTE]
> If you're setting the port below 1023, then you must run `sudo PORT=1023`

1. Create a GitHub account if you haven't already.
2. Click "Code" (green button) and then "Create Codespace on main."
3. In the terminal at the bottom, paste `pnpm i && pnpm start`.
4. Respond to the application popup by clicking "Make public."
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you click the "Make public." button, or the proxy won't function properly.<br>
> If you get a Range Error, go back and make sure you clicked Make public!
5. Access the deployed website from the ports tab.
6. For subsequent uses in the same codespace, just run `pnpm start`

### Solution for if there is no popup.

1. Run `pnpm i`, and before `pnpm start`, prepend `PORT=8080`, replacing 8080 with another port. For example, `PORT=6969 pnpm start`.
2. If this does not work then you can prepend `$env:PORT=8080;`, replacing 8080 with another port. For example, `$env:PORT=6969; pnpm start`
3. Go to the ports tab, Click Forward A Port, And type the port number.
4. Right-click Visibility and set Port Visibility to Public.
